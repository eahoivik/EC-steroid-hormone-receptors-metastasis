## EC-steroid-hormone-receptors-metastasis

This is a tentative research project website on endometrial cancer and how steroid receptors might mediate metastasis.    
Looking forward to develop this further as soon as funding is in place. We will keep the website updated, so you're on track with the project.   

### Project funding
We are grateful for the funding from::  xxx  

### About the project
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy and the third most common cause of death amongst female gynecological cancers patients (Sung, 2021). Unopposed estrogens, in part associated with obesity is a major risk factor. Despite the strong connections between estrogen signaling and endometrial cancer, our understanding of important molecular aspects of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) function remains poorly understood. Although most women are surgically cured by hysterectomy, approximately 20% presents with metastatic disease at primary surgery or develop metastases at later timepoints (Salvesen, 2009). When endometrial cancer has progressed to metastasis, it significantly affects survival and becomes universally lethal, like most metastatic human cancers. Current therapeutic approaches are limited (...)
